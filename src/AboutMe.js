                    New to coding but excited to learn more and build a career

                <br />
                Graduated in Law in 2015, after working 3 years as a lawyer, I
                came to the conclusion that this area wasn't meant for me. I
                wasn't happy. So I decided to look for other roles.
                <br />
                In 2020, I moved to Dublin, Ireland, with my husband, to study
                and improve my English skills. I had the opportunity to work in
                a bakery, as a confectioner. I liked working there but, still,
                it wasn't what I was looking for as a job to pursue a career.
                <br />
                In January 2022, another opportunity appeared, to move to
                Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal, where we are currently
                living. I kept looking for a job and, in July, I decided to
                study IT. <em>And that was what I was looking for!</em> I
                started learning C, and after a month, I enrolled the SheCodes
                workshops and started learning <strong>HTML</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. Now I'm
                focusing in <strong>React</strong>, which is becoming a passion.
                <br />
                I'm a self-motivated and enthusiastic person. I have a keen
                interest in developing new abilities and improving my skills,
                always giving my best to not disappoint anyone. I may be new to
                this area but I know that with my hardwork and focus, I can
                achieve anything and deliver results with excellence.
